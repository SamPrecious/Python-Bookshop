Hello,
I have a request that when testing you do the checkout module first and then the
return module. This way you can be sure to checkout a book and return it. For proof
of the test working the logfile should have a new line with all the details in
and the database should have updated member ID from 0 to 4423 after checkout then
back to 0 again when return is initiated.
It has been tested and works perfectly on many of the uni computers without a single error,
however it errors on one but i assume it just has an outdated version of matplotlib. Either way 
it should run smoothly with no errors as is.
